# Notification Types
## Email 
Email notifications are sent to you. You can specify that **other suite users** receive copies of the email. 
## Application 
* Notification is sent to a program that processes notices of events. 
* Not all event types support applications. Some support only email notification. 
* Applications that send events to IBM Business Process Manager require that you specify the credentials of an IBM BPM user. 
* Applications that send events to an IIS suite tool or product do not require credentials. 
  
# Subscriptions
* Two subscriptions are created automatically when you install **Data Quality Exception Console**, one subscription for each exception event type. 
* You must have the role of IIS Suite Admin to see and delete those subscriptions.
