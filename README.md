## Term
One of the major reasons for having a glossary of terms is to apply the terms to company information assets. 

### Associated Terms
* Related Terms: can be used as a catch-all if none of the other more specific relationships apply. 
* Assigned Terms: not sure what is it???  

### Assigned Assets
Asset types include:
* Glossary assets, such as categories. It is strange Term can be assgiend to Category asset???
* Database assets, such as database tables
* Data File assets, such as data files and data file records
* Data quality assets, such as data rules. We have Rules implemented by Data Rules, why assign them to Terms???
* ETL assets, such as DataStage jobs  

External Assets are defined by an IGC administrator. 

## Labels
* A text string used to group a set of terms together
* Created by an IGC administrator
* Can be applied to assets by any IGC user with authoring authorization.
